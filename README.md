# Exploratory Data Analysis and Classification of the Iris Dataset

## Abstract

This project implements a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) and supervised classification workflow on the Iris dataset using Python. The notebook demonstrates data understanding, preprocessing, visualization, and model-based classification to study feature relationships and evaluate predictive performance on a canonical machine learning dataset.

## 1. Introduction

The Iris dataset is a widely used benchmark in machine learning and statistics for studying classification techniques. It consists of measurements of sepal and petal dimensions across three iris species. The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset, visualize feature distributions, and apply classification algorithms to distinguish between species based on numerical attributes.

- 150 observations
- 4 numerical features:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- 3 target classes:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica
